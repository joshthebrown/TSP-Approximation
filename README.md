# TSP-Approximation
TSP Approximation Algorithm using a dynamic programming approach. It works by inputting an Upper bound B, which is compared to the minimum cost solution provided by the Hamiltonian Cycle algorithm which performs under O(n^2 * 2^n) time. Currently this implementation only works with a handful of cities, as this algorithm puts lots of strain on the CPU.
